```UPDATE REMINDER```

If you're like me and can't stop running the update command on your arch system every damn minute, maybe this program can help you.
It simply sends you a notification that you might want to update every monday, that's all it does, yet maybe it's enough to make us stop, we'll see.

```Installation```

Just copy the repo and run `sudo make install`, that's all.
